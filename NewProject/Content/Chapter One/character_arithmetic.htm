    <body><pre>character arithmetic</pre>
        <p>You will recall that all characters in Java are represented by 16 bit Unicode strings. So you might write the letter x, but the representation in memory is a 16 bit string. This means that the complete range of arithmetic operations are available on <code>char</code> types. This has greatest utility on operations with <i>Strings</i>, a data type we haven’t examined yet. (insert cross-reference) It can also be helpful for parsing files. Character arithmetic is not without its subtleties. Most important, when performing integer operations on <code>char</code> types, a cast to type <code>char</code> must always be included in the assignment. </p>
        <p>Let’s look first at an example using a <code>char</code> literal in the assignment.</p>
        <p style="font-family: Inconsolata;font-weight: normal;font-style: normal;font-size: 12pt;letter-spacing: 0em;color: #000000;text-decoration: none;"><code>char letter ='b' + 5;</code>
        </p>
        <p>As might be supposed, this expression evaluates to <code>g</code>. No cast is required because Java automatically recognizes the integer value of <code>'b'</code>. Things become more interesting when we use unrecognized <code>int</code> types in the assignment; Java requires an explicit cast. This example shows casting in action.</p>
        <blockquote>char letter1 = 'm';</blockquote>
        <blockquote>char letter2 = (char)('letter1' + 1);</blockquote>
        <blockquote>char letter3 = 'l' + 2;</blockquote>
        <p>This outputs the letter <code>n</code> for both <code>letter2</code> and <code>letter3</code>. Note the use of the explicit cast to type <code>char</code> in the second line. As mentioned, the memory representation of type <code>char</code> primitives is Unicode -- hexadecimal. To maintain the compatibility with type <code>char</code> in the assignment, the explicit cast is required. It is also possible to cast to type <code>int</code> and return the decimal value of letters: a = 1, b = 2, and so forth. Another method will return the Unicode hexadecimal value of characters. (insert reference to toString method; include hexToString).</p>
