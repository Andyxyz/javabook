    <body><pre>the java math library</pre>
        <p>Java contains a library with dozens of the most common mathematical functions, from trigonometry to exponents to generating random numbers. This is one of many <i>standard libraries</i> available in Java. Methods from the math library use the following form:</p>
        <blockquote>double result = Math.sin(x);</blockquote>
        <p>Where <code>x</code> is the angle in radians. <code>Math</code> followed by the <i>dot operator</i> refers to the math library, and <code>result</code> is of type <code>double.</code></p>
