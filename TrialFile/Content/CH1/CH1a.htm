        <h1>Data Primitives, Variables, and Math</h1>
        <p style="font-family: serif;">It's odd, in a way, to begin a book on Java by writing about data primitives, since Java is so strongly object-oriented. My Java Mentor, Maxim, has a positive aversion to numbers -- and he is a mathematician and physicist. He claims to have had little to do with numbers since the eighth grade. It's not that he has anything against number per se; he just resents them because they aren't objects. Still, we need them. Even Maxim concedes that, though he eyes any number with suspicion.</p>

        <p style="font-family: serif;">Java has nine built-in types called primitives. </p>
