        <p>integer division</p>
        <p>Strict typing plays a role in integer division as well. When integers are divided, the remainder is discarded. The results may not be what one would expect. 4/3 is equal to 1. For exact results, use floating point types.</p>
        <p>Java also provides an operation called <span class="Emphasis">modulus</span>, which calculates the remainder of integer division. For example, 4 % 2 is equal to 0, as there is no remainder. 3 %  2 is equal to 1, the value of the remainder. Modulus is useful in a variety of contexts, e.g., dividing up objects among a group or for production cycles, when the remaining quantity of goods or materials is sought.</p>
