        <p>character types</p>
        <p>Character types are individual characters. It is important to distinguish them from type <span class="code">String</span>, which is a basic and important type, but not a primitive. The <span class="code">String</span> type is a group of characters, not individual characters. (insert cross reference) When Java was originally released, it used the ASCII character set, based upon the English language, which includes support for only 128 characters. Current releases of Java instead use Unicode, which provides over 110,000 characters, including support for Cyrillic, Arabic, phonetic Japanese, and other alphabets. Support is also available for a wide variety of symbols, from currency symbols to mathematical operators.</p>
        <p>When we deal with characters, we are generally concerned with <span class="code">String</span> types. <span class="code">Char</span> types, because they are primitives, are more economically processed than <span class="code">String</span> types. Many <span class="code">String</span> methods operate on <span class="code">char</span> types. These methods are too numerous to elaborate in their entirety here. Among the more important <span class="code">char</span> type operations on strings are; decomposition; ordering; identifying; changing case; and changing position. We will deal more extensively with these operations when we discuss <span class="code">String</span> types. (insert cross reference)</p>
        <p>Characters are also used in <span class="Emphasis">escape sequences. </span>Escape sequences are reserved for characters which cannot be entered by default from the keyboard. Many of these are <span class="Emphasis">control characters,</span> which control the output of text by inserting a tab, a new line, etc. For example, the escape sequence for a new line is <span class="code">\n</span>. (insert table of control characters) Printing to the console, or monitor, makes extensive use of control characters to control the appearance of output. Another use for escape sequences is to enter a symbol or other special character. Thus, to insert the symbol for Sterling, <span class="_Override" style="font-family: Inconsolata;font-size: 11pt;line-height: 13pt;">£,</span>type <span class="code">\u00A3,</span> which is the hexadecimal value for the symbol in Unicode. Escape sequences are always preceded by the backslash character, \, the letter u, and generally employ Unicode, though other encoding schemes are recognized.</p>
