        <p>Boolean types have the values <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. In Java, boolean types are used most frequently for logical control over the way a program executes. (insert cross reference) By combining values with the boolean modifiers <span class="Emphasis"><code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, </span>and <span class="Emphasis"><code>not</code>,</span> sophisticated logical structures may be produced. A simple example might contain the two elements necessary for drinking alcohol legally: being 21 and having ID to prove it. But there are times when another control structure might be preferred, for example the contrapositive, which both inverts and negates a conditional statement. Thus, the conditional statement, if you are 21 and have ID, then you can order a drink may be recast: you cannot order a drink if you are not 21 or do not have ID. In practice, this flexibility is important. In fact, more often than not, it is the negated form which warns away underage patrons in a bar or package store!</p>
